Before leaving the lab, Dr. Eisenhower takes a moment to note down his thoughts.
Seven years have passed since his death in the experiment - he does not know what to expect, once you steps out.

Dr. Eisenhower's diary entry: 
we write the year 2080, October 13th. After collecting all my important results and equipment, I have to leave this place.
Probably its best to go and find Victor. Maybe he can help me - or at least explain to me how this was possible! Everybody seams to have lost their soul, it's horror. Maybe another experiment went wrong... I have to find out.
